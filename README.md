This library is made to help make **better** psuedo-randomized numbers in C++.
# **RandomFwoof**

`RandomFwoof` will give you a way to have better ***(and faster)*** psuedo-randomized numbers than `srand()` ever can! 
#
### We achieve this by giving each person a lot of customizability when generating numbers, ***and it's easy to use!*** ðŸŽ‰

## **Better psuedo-random Number Library for C++.**
<br>

This library was designed to let developers get improved randomized numbers in C++. 

### Features include:
- Has the ability to set RNG seeds multiple times.
<br>

- Has the ability to set Application Specific Seeds too!

`RandomFwoof` will give you a way to have **better (and faster)** psuedo-randomized numbers than `srand()` and `rand()` can ever generate! 


- RandomFwoof achieves this by giving the developer a lot of customizability when generating numbers, ***and it's easy to use!*** ðŸŽ‰

- We allow the developer to have a system that generates better psuedo-randomn numbers than other options.

### With this library you can:
- Put in Application Random Seeds.
- Use Automatically Changing Random Seeds.

You can change flags (settings) with `setFlag(string, bool)`. There is currently only one flag though! It is `rerollrandomseed`! It is automatically on and it means that the random seed will reroll when reaching the end automatically!
When you use `setRandomSeed(int tick, int ARS)` you can use `time(NULL)` for the tick, and you can use `0` to have a application random seed to be automatically computed!

### How do Application Random Seeds (ARS) work?
- We give the developer an option to have another number that is also included in the formula to calculate the random numbers!
