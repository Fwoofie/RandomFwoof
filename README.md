# RandomFwoof

## A lightweight solution to random numbers.
<br>

<p style="text-align: center;"> 
This library was made to let developers get <span style="font-weight:bold">better</span> randomized numbers in C++. 
</p>

<br>
<br>

`RandomFwoof` will give you a way to have **better** psuedo-randomized numbers than `srand()` and `rand()` can ever generate! 

- RandomFwoof achieves this by giving the developer a lot of <span style="color:rgb(0, 76, 255)">customizability</span> when generating numbers, ***and it's easy to use!*** ðŸŽ‰


- We allow the developer to have a system that generates better psuedo-randomness than other options.
